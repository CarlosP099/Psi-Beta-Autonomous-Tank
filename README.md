# Psi-Beta-Autonomous-Tank


Theta Tau Mu Gamma: Pledge Construction Project 
I. Assignment 
The Psi Beta Pledge Class is to construct an autonomous tank that is capable of operating a Nerf rifle.

Prerequisites include the completion of shop safety training

II. Preface 
The members of Psi Beta are continuing to foster social bonds through their second week of pledging. Psi Beta’s ability to mobilize to work towards a common goal will be assessed by the construction of their project. The craftsmanship and attention to detail of their work will be a metaphor representative of traits that make outstanding brothers and engineers. 

III. Constraints and Requirements 
Create a Rolling Action Item List outlining task delegation, scheduling of tasks (To-Do List), Finance documentation, and Bill of Material documentation. 
To be made of the most feasible material. 
Must be able to operate Nerf Hyper rifle without any human input.

Must be able to transport itself through obstacles.
All faces and edges must be sanded to a smooth even surface. No gouges, nicks, or jagged  edges. 
The tank must be painted dark red alternating with gold. ΘT and ΨB must be painted on somewhere on the tank.
No outside help is allowed. All work must be done by pledges of the Psi Beta pledge class. 

IV. Design Process 
As engineers, our job is to be as efficient as possible. As a pledge class, you will achieve efficiency by laying out and designing your fabrication process with great detail. With a well thought-out design, there is no reason this project should take more than one trial on any step to complete. All pledges will be required to pull their weight of the effort in some way shape or form. Delegate tasks within the pledge class based on skills, availability, and resources. Assigning these tasks with a time deadline as part of a rigid schedule will help the fabrication process finish smoothly and on-time.

V. Communication 
Communication is another key element in completing tasks efficiently and effectively. The class should emphasize communication to each other with these fields: task and stage completions, delays, problems, locations, and need for assistance (i.e., “YOU’RE NOT HELPING OUT ENOUGH”). Not only is communication important within a pledge class, but it is also important to establish a fluent communication method with your marshals. We want updates on how things are going, so we are expecting to be updated regularly on several specifics. 

VI. Deliverables 
Discord updates throughout the project process as such: 
When all materials have been purchased (E.G. Plywood, paint, etc.) 
When all surfaces and edges are sanded smooth - when painting is completed 

Design Process outlining task delegation, scheduling of  tasks (To-Do List), finance documentation, and Bill of Material documentation. 
All Pledges are responsible to pull their own weight and should update their time log sheets regularly 
Pledge class officers must ensure the completion of the above documentation 

Constructed Project 
Refer to section III for specifications 

Presentation/Photos 
Photos shall be taken throughout the process 
PowerPoint slides shall be put together and ready to be presented 

VII. Deadlines 
Comprehensive plans should be put together and presented by two representatives from the  pledge class by Monday 3/6.
Autonomous tank must be operational  by 3/13.
Autonomous tank must be painted and able to fully mount the rifle and operate it, it must be finished and presented to brothers by 3/27.


VIII. Remarks 
This is your opportunity to showcase your dynamic to work as a team. We are asking you, as a pledge class, to create something that you are proud and confident enough to present to others. All pledge classes before Psi Beta have constructed their projects and recognized it as a symbol of pride. Psi Beta shall carry on this legacy; we expect nothing but the best.
